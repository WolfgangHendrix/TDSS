Top Down Space Shooter (Unreal Engine)
License considered is Nephilim Squadron because it's by Melvin Allen and it's an attainable IP we can use for cross promotional purposes. IP seems to be a good fit as it's also a space shooter in nature with layers of abstract existential concepts. Sounds perfect for a game.
